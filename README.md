A simple but interesting visual showing in-depth shot detail of the winning goal in the Euros 2024 finals, scored by Mikel Oyarzabal.    

The plot shows the shot-taker along with the defenders of the opposing team and attacking teammates present in the 'frame' at the time of the shot being released.     

I used the statsbomb open data for the data like action coordinates and player names and jersey numbers.    

Using the mplsoccer library, I customised the pitch design, adding elements in the correct locations.

Using this template, you can produce plots for any shot of any match_id having adequate data for the shot 'frame'.
